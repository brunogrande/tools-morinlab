# Test data for toolkit

We are in the process of collating data sets used to generate the images in our biorXiv manuscript. To use this data, upload each file to your custom Galaxy instance or Docker image and run the tools. 
Larger files that are needed to run some of these tools (e.g. reference fasta files, genome-wide gc content etc) has been posted to our [public FTP serven](ftp://ftp03.bcgsc.ca/public/ensembl/)
