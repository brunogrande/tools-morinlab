# Test data for toolkit

The subdirectories here contain data sets that will allow you to reproduce images from our paper (Albuquerque et al). To use this data, upload each file to your custom Galaxy instance or Docker image and run the tools listed in the Readme associated with each folder. 

Larger files that are needed to run some of these tools (e.g. reference fasta files, genome-wide gc content etc) has been posted to our public FTP server:
