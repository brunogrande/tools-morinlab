# Testing GISTIC2.0
The two files here are the two inputs needed by GISTIC. These were created by running the igv2gistic tool with an Agilent SureSelect bait definition and a single (merged) seg file containing all segmented copy number data from a cohort of lymphoma patients. For genomes other than hg19 or for other exome kits, you will need to create these files uisng those tools. 

These files can be analyzed using the GISTIC tool as shown in Supplemental Figure 6 in Albuquerque et al. to regenerate the copy number results provided in Figures 6 and 7.
