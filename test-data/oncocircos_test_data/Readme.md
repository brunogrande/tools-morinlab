# Oncocircos testing
This tool requires several input files (some may be left empty). Two gene lists allow the user to mask (blacklist.txt) and specifically highlight in color (example_genes_to_label.txt) a subset of genes. An annotation file that provides a unique identifier for each gene alongside genomic coordinates is also required. We have provided one here that can be readily reproduced using the Ensembl biomart, or even more easily, using the R [biomaRt package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomaRt.html). The main data inputs are a merged set of segmented data similar to that used by GISTIC and the merged MAF-format mutation data from the same cohort. Finally, peak regions deemed significant by GISTIC can also be provided (gistic_sigregions.bed). For more details, see an [example workflow](https://github.com/morinlab/tools-morinlab/tree/master/workflows#running-gistic-on-cnv-results-and-generating-oncocircos-visualization).

## Regenerating Figure 6 from Albuquerque et al
To run the tool on the test data from the DLBCL cohorts, upload each of these files to a Galaxy instance with the Oncocircos tool installed. Ensure that you set the file format for "gistic_sigregions.bed" to bed so that it is seen as a valid input. Set the cutoff for the number of mutations to some value higher than 1 with larger data sets such as this.
