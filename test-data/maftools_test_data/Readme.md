# MAFtools suite of Galaxy visualization tools
These files can be used to reproduce a variety of the images generated with our Galaxy tools based on the [MAFtools R package](https://github.com/PoisonAlien/maftools). Upload the gzipped maf file in this directory to a Galaxy instance with the maftools package installed and ensure that you set the data type to "MAF". We realize that this clashes with another distinct data type in Galaxy and hope to remedy this ambiguity with future releases. Suggestions and/or pull requests are welcome!
