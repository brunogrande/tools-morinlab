IGV2Gistic converts an IGV-formatted segment file into a GISTIC2.0 compatible segment file. This script is intended for segment files produced by Copy Number Variation (CNV) callers. This script effectively allows for running GISTIC2.0 on copy number segments derived from sequencing data (as opposed to array derived copy number segments).

Additionally, this script requires a BED file containing coordinates of exons. 

Both the IGV-formatted segment file and the BED file must have the "chr" prefix for any chromosomes. Both files must not have a header line.

IGV-formatted segment file is a tabular file with the following columns: 
  (1) Sample
  (2) Chromsome (chr prefix required)
  (3) Start position
  (4) End position
  (5) Copy number 

Minimum exon BED file should contain the following columns:
  (1) Chromosome
  (2) Start position
  (3) End position
